        To Impact the Afternoon and Evening Commute...\nSnow will continue to overspread
        the region through the rest of\nthe afternoon. Snowfall intensities may briefly
        become heavy at\ntimes late this afternoon and into the early evening. The\ncombination
        of reduced visibilities and snow accumulations on\nroadways at rush hour will
        likely lead to travel challenges into\nthis evening. A coating to one inch
        of snow is expected, but\npockets of 1 to 2 inch amounts are possible.\nPlan
        on adding additional time to your commute as a result. Slow\ndown, and allow
        for extra stopping distance as slick spots are\nlikely, especially on untreated
        and elevated surfaces."}]}'
